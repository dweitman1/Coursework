<i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>: 10/10
<p>
!SPOILERS AHEAD!</br>
<fieldset style="color: #bf0000; width: 600px;">
<i>Avengers: Infinity</i> is the latest Avengers movie, being followed by
the scheduled <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> in April 2019. The film closely follows
the antagonist, Thanos, as he attempts to gather the six mystical infinity stones.
Upon acquiring all six of the stones Thanos will kill half of all creatures 
within the universe. However, while Thanos' plan is vile he has no ill intent. Thanos 
hopes to solve the overpopulation problem by simply giving half the universe a painless
death. However, the heroes of the film see the flaws in Thanos' plan as well as fight 
for all beings in the universe. Unfortunately, Thanos ends up collecting all the stones,
despite the heroes putting up their best efforts to stop him (while getting close). The 
heroes then watch as roughly half of the people around them just disappear from existence.
The movie ends on this plot hole and the plot is set to be picked up in <i> Avengers: 
Endgame </i>.
