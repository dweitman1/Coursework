(a)
In populateList the parameter of the integer 
list is passed by reference, meaning that the 
memory addresses the IntegerList are passed into
the function and actually change/populate the 
elements in the memory addresses for which 
IntegerList is passed into the function. However,
populateList2 is passed by value meaning that it
does not alter the original IntegerList passed 
into the function and rather just populates the 
locally created IntegerList.
